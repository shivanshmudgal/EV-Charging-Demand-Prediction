# EV-Charging-Demand-Prediction
As electric vehicle (EV) adoption continues to accelerate, urban planners must proactively assess and enhance infrastructureâ€”especially the availability of charging stations. Insufficient preparation risks creating congestion and reducing user satisfaction, ultimately jeopardizing environmental targets.

ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
Leverage historical data on EV registrationsâ€”including vehicle types, regional trends, and usage patternsâ€”to develop a predictive model that forecasts future electric vehicle demand. This model will support strategic infrastructure decisions and sustainable growth planning.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal
Create a regression-based forecasting model that predicts future EV adoption by analyzing:

Monthly registration trends

Vehicle categories (passenger vs. truck)

Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)

County-level variations and regional factors

ðŸ“Š Dataset Description
Source: Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) Timeframe: January 31, 2017 â€“ February 29, 2024 Granularity: Monthly counts by county

Key Variables:
Date: End-of-month timestamp for vehicle registration data

County: Residential location of vehicle owner

Vehicle Primary Use: Passenger (83%) and Truck (17%)

BEVs: Vehicles fully powered by onboard electric batteries

PHEVs: Vehicles partially powered by electric batteries

EV Total: Combined count of BEVs and PHEVs

Non-EV Total: Vehicles not classified as electric

Total Vehicles: All vehicles registered in each county

Percent EVs: Share of EVs relative to total registered vehicles
